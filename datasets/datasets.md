# Datasets Used for AI Model

This document outlines the datasets used in training the AI model for instance segmentation.

## Datasets Overview

The AI model for instance segmentation was trained using a merged dataset containing the following datasets:

### 1. **Acne Dataset**
   - **Description:** The dataset contains images of acne in various forms, annotated for training models in detecting and segmenting acne instances.
   - **Source 1:** [Acne Dataset in YOLOv8 Format](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmankagankurnaz/acne-dataset-in-yolov8-format)
   - **Source 2:** [Acne Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anand-itt/acne-detection)

### 2. **Dark Circle Dataset**
   - **Description:** This dataset contains images annotated with dark circles under the eyes, used to train models for detecting and segmenting dark circles.

## Merged Dataset
The final training dataset was a merged collection of these two acne datasets, curated and pre-processed for model training.

### Pre-processing Steps
1. **Data Augmentation:** [Describe any augmentation techniques used]
2. **Annotation:** [Describe the annotation format (e.g., bounding boxes, segmentation masks)]
3. **Normalization:** [Details of any normalization done on the data]
